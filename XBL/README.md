XBL
===

A Javascript library providing a DOM binding / behavior engine.

Background
----------

XBL stands for XML Binding Language. 
This code DOES NOT support currently support XML or XBL, 
but it is derived from the [XBLUI project](http://www.meekostuff.net/projects/XBLUI/) 
which is a (partial) Javascript implementation of the 
[initial XBL 2.0 specification](http://www.w3.org/TR/2007/CR-xbl-20070316/).

The name is not so appropriate now because XBL2 is no longer recommended 
and XML is out of favor on the web. 

The code now supports a Javascript API similar to that envisaged by the [XBL 2.0 working group note](http://www.w3.org/TR/2012/NOTE-xbl-20120524/) of 2012.
